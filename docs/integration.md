# Integration guide — how a host adopts context continuity

This guide is for a **host** author: a plugin that wants a durable subject to
live one continuous context across many physical Sessions. The Agent Team is
one host (its subject is a Member); a single-Individual harness like Loom is
another (its subject is the Individual); a long-running coding agent is its own
single subject.

The engine owns the universal mechanics — the idle-boundary generation swap,
the admission gate, carried input, checkpoint continuations, the projection
fold, the lineage walk, the shared return-anchor policy, the model-facing tools
with their validation, the bounded retrieval ladder, and the pressure policy. It
knows nothing about what your subject is or what your domain treats as
meaningful. You supply exactly that, through the seams below.

## Seams

Every seam below is **shipped**: implemented and unit-tested in this package.

| Seam | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Subject identity | shipped |
| Message codec | shipped |
| Projection (`ContextProjectionHost` + fold unit) | shipped |
| Coordinator (`ContextContinuityHost`) | shipped |
| Timeline read (`readContextTimeline`) | shipped |
| Tools factory (`createContinuityTools`) | shipped |
| Retrieval ladder (`createSearchTools`, `SearchScopeProvider`) | shipped |
| Pressure policy (`ContextPressurePolicy`) | shipped |

Everything a host reaches for is exported from the package root
(`@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity`).

## The one-paragraph model

A **subject** is a durable identity with, at any moment, one bound Session
generation. When context fills or the model asks, the subject *rolls over*:
the engine prepares a `TransitionPlan`, the host performs the swap in its own
lifecycle, and the subject continues in a fresh Session seeded by a handoff.
A **checkpoint** records a restorable anchor; a **timeline** walks the subject's
Session lineage (`parentSession` chain) as one continuous history; **search**
recalls across the sessions the host authorizes. Every durable fact lives in
the Session log; the engine derives, never stores a second copy.

## Seam 1 — subject identity (shipped)

Pick the id type your domain already has, and describe a subject as its id plus
the Session it is bound to right now.

```ts
import type { ContextSubject } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

type SubjectId = AgentTeamMemberId          // Team
// type SubjectId = IndividualId            // Loom (one value, always the same)

// A subject the engine reads: nothing more than id + current sessionId.
const subject: ContextSubject<SubjectId> = { id, sessionId }
```

The engine reads nothing else off a subject. Roles, workspaces, memory paths,
team membership all stay on the host side.

## Seam 2 — message codec (shipped)

The codec writes and reads the durable handoff and checkpoint-continuation
messages, through the shipped `plugin` snapshot form. Construct it once.

```ts
import { ContextMessageCodec } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

const codec = new ContextMessageCodec({
  pluginId: '@wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team',                              // your plugin's stable id
  handoffIntro: 'Context handoff: you are continuing as the same Team Member…',
  handoffVerifyNote: 'Your handoff follows. Verify external state before relying on it…',
})
```

Only `pluginId` and the two prose lines are yours. **Section names are fixed
by the engine** — a host that changed them could not decode its own history.

> **Durable identity — never change after first ship:** `pluginId` is written
> into every handoff/continuation message's `source.plugin` and matched on read.
> Change it and every past generation's messages become unreadable.

## Seam 3 — projection (shipped)

The projection folds one Session's continuity state from its log. The engine
owns the universal structure (checkpoints, pending rollover, continuation
delivery, carry candidates, open calls, turn cursors). You contribute only your
domain's ref naming and your timeline anchors, through `ContextProjectionHost`.

```ts
import { createContextProjectionDefinition, type ContextProjectionHost } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

const projectionHost: ContextProjectionHost = {
  // Durable, collision-resistant refs. Two Sessions repeating one provider
  // call id MUST produce two distinct refs — key on the Session id.
  checkpointRefFor: (sessionId, toolCallId) => `${sessionId}:ckpt:${sha(toolCallId)}`,
  boundaryRefFor:   (sessionId, seq)        => `${sessionId}:b:${seq}`,

  // Which of YOUR effect calls may anchor a boundary on success. The engine
  // already tracks its own rollover/checkpoint calls; omit if you have none.
  tracksCall: (name) => name === 'team_message' || name === 'team_claim',

  // Your timeline anchor for one event, or undefined when it anchors nothing.
  // Team: a committed message / claim change / a Thread's FIRST arrival.
  // Loom: a committed Input / Effect / Delivery fact.
  domainBoundaryOf: (input) => {
    // input.seenTopics lets you decide what a *first* arrival is in your terms.
    if (/* input is a first thread arrival */ false) {
      return { kind: 'team_thread_arrival', label: 'First arrival: …', topics: [threadId] }
    }
    return undefined
  },

  isEphemeralNotice: (message) => /* your domain's transient notices */ false,
}
```

Register the fold with the Harness projection framework, which owns the drive
(replay, incremental application, persistence, invalidation):

```ts
import { createContextProjectionDefinition } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

// Register ONCE for the whole host — not once per Session. The framework keeps
// one unit per projection key, and this engine's state carries the Session
// identity it folded.
ctx.sessionProjections.register(createContextProjectionDefinition({
  codec, host: projectionHost,
  // Fold a legacy tool alias too, if your history carries one:
  rolloverToolNames: ['context_rollover', 'new_context'],
}))
```

One registration serves every Session, seeded successors included. `init` reads
the header and records the Session id and its fork-inherited prefix length in
the state; `apply` skips events below that cut, returning the same state
reference; every ref is keyed by the state's own Session. A generation that
folded its inherited prefix would re-key its ancestor's checkpoints under its
own id — refs the ancestor's log does not know — and re-derive the ancestor's
completed rollover intent as its own pending swap.

The coordinator reads this state back through `host.projectionForSubject` — you
may return the framework's folded state, or fold by hand with
`foldContextProjection(events, config, { sessionId, inheritedEventCount })`.
Both converge on one value (cold == live).

**Anchor policy the engine owns:** a boundary is a selectable default return
anchor exactly when it resolved at a completed turn and is attributable to
exactly one topic. What a *topic* is (`attributions`) is your call — a Thread,
a continuity line, a repo. Multi-topic or mid-turn boundaries are searchable
evidence but not default return targets.

## Seam 4 — coordinator (shipped)

Implement `ContextContinuityHost<SubjectId>` and drive the coordinator from your
Session-event dispatch.

```ts
import { ContextContinuityCoordinator, type ContextContinuityHost } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

const host: ContextContinuityHost<SubjectId> = {
  agentForSubject:   (id) => handles.get(id)?.agent,
  subjectForAgent:   (agent) => resolveSubject(agent),           // → { id, sessionId } | undefined
  projectionForSubject: (id, sid) => readFoldedState(id, sid),   // from seam 3
  executeTransition: (id, plan) => performSwap(id, plan),        // see contract below
  rolloverIdentity:  (prevSessionId, toolCallId) => ({           // durable naming — yours
    newSessionId: `myhost-rollover-${sha([prevSessionId, toolCallId])}`,
    requestId:    `myhost:rollover:${sha([prevSessionId, toolCallId])}`,
  }),
  isEphemeralNotice: (message) => /* same rule as seam 3 */ false,
  log: (message) => ctx.logger.warn(message),
}

const coordinator = new ContextContinuityCoordinator(host, codec)
```

Wire it (call sites are yours; the coordinator holds only reconstructible
process state):

- **On every subject Session event:** `coordinator.onSessionEvent(id, agent, event)`.
- **At a subject's turn-stop boundary, before the turn closes:**
  `coordinator.captureQueuedInput(agent)` — real input is preserved for delivery
  after the handoff, ephemeral notices are dropped.
- **Before admitting queued input to an old generation:** consult
  `coordinator.needsAdmissionGate(agent)`.
- **During subject activation (crash recovery):**
  `coordinator.recoverPendingTransition(id, agent, sessionId)` and, for quiet
  continuations, `coordinator.repairContinuations(agent, state)`.
- **On subject dispose/removal:** `coordinator.stopTracking(id)`.

### `executeTransition` contract

Perform one prepared swap at a true idle boundary, in your lifecycle: commit the
rollover, dispose the old Agent, archive the old Session, create and activate the
successor (seed it — `SessionStore.create({ seed, meta })` — with the handoff via
`coordinator.handoffMessageFor(plan)` delivered first, then `plan.carriedInput`).
Resolve once the subject runs its new generation; **reject to leave the previous
generation recoverable** (never half-swap).

> **Durable identity — keep stable:** `rolloverIdentity`'s Session-id and
> request-id scheme is what makes an interrupted rollover converge on one
> operation across restart. Changing the scheme risks a duplicate successor.

## Seam 5 — timeline read (shipped)

`readContextTimeline` walks the subject's lineage — the current generation, then
archived ancestors through your stored-Session reader — and returns the bounded,
priced list of return anchors behind `context_timeline`. The engine owns the
walk, the dedupe, the pricing, and the shared restorable-anchor rule; you supply
the mechanism it cannot have as a pure library.

```ts
import { readContextTimeline } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

const timeline = await readContextTimeline({
  current: {
    sessionId: agent.session.id,
    header: agent.session.header,
    inheritedEventCount: agent.session.inheritedEventCount,
    events: agent.session.snapshotEvents(),      // the cut is handled by the fold
  },
  config,                                        // the same fold config as seam 3
  readAncestor: id => sessionReader.read(id),    // your StoredSessionReader
  measureSource: source => source.sessionId === agent.session.id
    ? meter?.measure(agent.session)?.totalTokens
    : measureStoredLog(source),                  // your own replay of the ancestor
  currentUsageTokens: meter?.measure(agent.session)?.totalTokens ?? 0,
  handoffAt,                                     // from your route limits
})
```

- **The engine prices; you measure.** A pure library has no `tokenMeter` on
  `ctx`, so measurement arrives as `measureSource` — the *source's own* replayed
  token count, so a small current generation never shrinks a large ancestor's
  real seed cost. `undefined` means unmeasurable: those anchors stay listed with
  a reason instead of being priced as free.
- **Anchors are structural.** Resolved checkpoints, resolved host boundaries
  (your `domainBoundaryOf` contributions), and the current head. An unresolved
  anchor is not a candidate, and an archived generation contributes no head.
- **The restorable rule is the one `context_rollover` uses:** a boundary is
  selectable exactly when it resolved at a completed turn and is attributable to
  exactly one topic; a checkpoint while its retained context stays below
  `handoffAt`. Every non-restorable anchor carries its reason.
- **An unreadable ancestor ends the walk and is reported** in `incompleteFrom`:
  history is then complete through the last listed generation, and never
  silently short.

## Seam 6 — tools factory (shipped)

The product surface: one factory produces the three model-facing tools — with
fixed names — from your adapter plus optional prose. The engine keeps the
argument contract, the anti-forgery gate, the `concludeTurn()` timing, and the
render shapes; you perform every effect.

```ts
import { createContinuityTools } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

const tools = createContinuityTools({
  // resolve the calling execution to its subject, then answer/act
  isRestorableRef: (ref, exec) => timelineOffered(subjectOf(exec), ref),
  requestRollover: (request, exec) => lifecycle.requestRollover(subjectOf(exec), request),
  recordCheckpoint: ({ name, callId }, exec) => bindings.record(subjectOf(exec), name, callId),
  timeline: ({ limit }, exec) => readTimeline(subjectOf(exec), limit),
}, {              // optional; sensible domain-neutral defaults
  subjectNoun: 'Team Member',
  rolloverChecklist: '…what a handoff must cover in your domain…',
  checkpointGuidance: '…when to bury an anchor…',
})
// register tools.rollover / tools.checkpoint / tools.timeline
```

- **The engine decides, you report the fact.** `isRestorableRef` answers whether
  this subject recorded that ref and a timeline offered it; the engine turns a
  `false` into a model-visible rejection. A fabricated ref never becomes a silent
  fresh rollover, and your verdict must agree with the timeline's own `restorable`
  flag (`readContextTimeline`) — one policy, two readers.
- **`concludeTurn()` follows the durable intent, never precedes it.** The rollover
  and checkpoint bodies conclude the turn only after your adapter resolves; a
  rejection leaves the previous generation running and is what the model sees.
  `context_timeline` is a read: it never concludes a turn.
- **Validation has two layers.** The declared parameter schema rejects wrong
  types at the tool boundary (`ToolArgsError`); the body owns what a JSON Schema
  cannot express — a non-blank handoff within the 32 KiB cap, at most 32 related
  files each with a non-blank path and reason, and a blank `checkpointRef` that
  would otherwise read as absent. Either rejection is model-visible and touches
  no host state.
- **Names are fixed:** `context_rollover`, `context_checkpoint`,
  `context_timeline`. The prose you override refers to them by name, so only
  subject-facing vocabulary is yours: the anti-forgery sentence, "a context change
  never rolls back an external effect", and the jobs/memory discipline are
  engine-owned and survive any override.
- **The contract is deliberately generic.** A tool value carries `ref`, `label`,
  and `affectedTopics`, not one host's words for a Thread or a Claim: the same
  factory serves every host. Your render-facing vocabulary belongs in `text`.

## Seam 7 — the retrieval ladder (shipped)

`context_search` and `context_read` are the product surface for recall: a
bounded ranked question, then one expanded neighbourhood. The engine owns the
ladder's contract, the canonical `contextRef` codec, provenance folding, the
budgets, and the return-anchor verdict; you own authorization, the query
capability, the fold configuration, and the meter.

```ts
import { createSearchTools } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

const tools = createSearchTools({
  subject: exec => subjectOf(exec),
  activeSessionId: exec => sessionIdOf(exec),
  scope: {
    // Default range: every Session this subject ever lived in.
    ownedSessions: subject => ledger.sessionsOf(subject),
    // Named scopes you define — a Team workspace or team; Loom usually has none.
    availableScopes: subject => teamsOf(subject).map(team => ({ scopeId: team.id, label: team.name })),
    sessionsInScope: (subject, scopeId) => ledger.sessionsOfSubjectIn(subject, scopeId),
  },
  query: ctx.sessionQuery,                       // the Harness capability, unchanged
  config,                                        // the same fold config as seams 3 and 5
  measureSource: (source, exec) => measuredTokensOf(source),
  handoffAt: exec => handoffBudgetOf(exec),
})
// register tools.search / tools.read
```

- **Scope is derived by you, never declared by the model.** `ownedSessions` is
  the default range; a model-supplied `scope` only *selects* among
  `availableScopes`, an unoffered scope is a model-visible rejection that lists
  the offered ones, and an empty authorized set refuses to run rather than
  searching everything. Every query carries
  `sessionFilters: [{ kind: 'id', values: <authorized> }]`, and a hit a provider
  returns outside that set is dropped and counted, never presented.
- **The query capability is injected, not reached for.** The engine is a pure
  library with no `ctx` (see seam 5), so you pass `ctx.sessionQuery` — typed by
  the published `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session-query` contract through the four reads
  the ladder uses: `searchSessions`, `searchEvents`, `filterEvents`,
  `readSession`. That declaration is the whole dependency: `ContextSearchPort` is
  an interface with those four methods, and `SessionQueryEngine` satisfies it
  structurally, so there is no adapter glue.
- **The capability is only as open as the deployment.** A mounted
  `ctx.sessionQuery` is not a working search: stock DSH ships the
  `session-query-sqlite` row with `openAt: never`, which keeps exact reads,
  titles, and lineage traces available while `searchSessions` and `searchEvents`
  fail with `SESSION_QUERY_SEARCH_DISABLED` and SQLite is never opened. Tell your
  operator the prerequisite rather than letting the ladder look broken: the index
  opens in a later patch layer (the profile's own patch, or a `--patch` overlay)
  with `openAt: first-search` — which defers both the `node:sqlite` import and the
  build to the first search — plus a durable `path`, because an ephemeral
  `:memory:` index rebuilds on every start. Two facts belong with the switch: the
  build ingests every *stored* Session inside one failure boundary, so a single
  stored log the Harness format ladder refuses (pre-v3 leftovers it will not
  migrate, a corrupt log) fails every search rather than that one Session — check
  an existing session store can fold before enabling search on it — and the first
  search pays the whole build, after which the index is incremental. The read half
  (`filterEvents`, `readSession`) needs no index, which is why `context_read`
  keeps working while `context_search` does not.
- **A `contextRef` grants nothing.** `context-hit-<base64url([sessionId, seq])>`
  names the generation that *recorded* an event, round-trips across restarts, and
  is rejected when it is not the exact canonical form this codec issued.
  Ownership is revalidated on every read against `ownedSessions` plus every
  offered scope, because a read takes no scope parameter and a ref may have come
  from a scoped search.
- **One inherited experience appears once.** A seeded generation repeats its
  source's events at the same seqs, so a hit below its `inheritedEventCount` is
  folded along `parentSession` to its real source before dedupe; when that folds
  away a generation's strongest match, its own span is searched so its later
  experience is still represented.
- **Returning is optional enrichment.** A hit carries a `checkpointRef` only when
  its source generation is on the active lineage *and* an anchor whose completed
  turn contains the hit passes the shared policy — the same `anchorCandidates`
  and `anchorRejection` the timeline uses, so the two surfaces cannot disagree.
  Otherwise the hit states `unavailable — <reason>`; a ref is never synthesized,
  and an off-lineage branch is searchable but is not a return target.
- **The model surface has no paging.** No cursor, no page size, no Session id, no
  event type: the budgets are `CONTEXT_SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT`,
  `CONTEXT_READ_BEFORE` / `CONTEXT_READ_AFTER`, and `CONTEXT_READ_EVENT_CHARS`. A
  capped answer says so and asks for a narrower query, time range, or `within`.
- **`within` deep-searches one generation's own span.** Copying a hit's
  `contextRef` into `within` searches the generation that recorded it, not its
  inherited prefix — that history already belongs to, and is attributed to, its
  own generation.
- **Errors are readable, not raw.** Provider failures reach the model as one
  sanitized sentence; a bad ref, an unoffered scope, a time bound without a
  timezone, and a stale seq each say what was wrong and what to do instead.

## Seam 8 — context pressure (shipped)

`ContextPressurePolicy` decides when a subject is told to prepare a handoff, and
what happens when it is at its limit. The engine owns the decision order, the
once-per-generation latch, and the proof a reduction has to earn; you own the
meter, the reduction capability, the steer, and what the notice calls whatever
the subject is holding.

```ts
import { ContextPressurePolicy } from '@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity'

const pressure = new ContextPressurePolicy<MemberId>({
  pluginId: AGENT_TEAM_PLUGIN_ID,               // whose notice this is, on read-back
  limitsFor: member => routeLimitsForMember(member),   // meter + route window + reserves
  surfaceFor: member => ({
    generation: surfaceReplaceGenerationOf(member),
    tokens: meterOf(member)?.measure(sessionOf(member))?.totalTokens,
  }),
  compactionFor: member => compactionServiceOf(member),  // { reduce(reason, signal) }
  logSpanFor: member => ({
    sessionId: String(sessionOf(member).id),
    inheritedEventCount: Number(sessionOf(member).inheritedEventCount),
    events: sessionOf(member).snapshotEvents(),
  }),
  inHandFor: member => ({ inHand: activeClaimLabels(member), jobs: runningJobLabels(member) }),
  steer: (member, notice) => sessionOf(member).steer(notice),
  failedFor: (member, diagnostic) => setMemberFailure(member, 'compaction', diagnostic),
  log: (message, member) => ctx.logger.warn(`agent-team: ${message} (member ${member})`),
}, { inHandLabel: 'Active Claims', jobsLabel: 'Owner jobs' })

const decision = await pressure.onPreStep(member, signal)   // continue | notice | reject
```

- **Two thresholds, one order.** Below the handoff budget nothing happens; at it
  one notice is steered into the running turn; at the hard limit the request is
  forced through a reduction first. A request at the hard limit is never merely
  noticed.
- **The notice is durable evidence, not process state.** The latch reads the
  subject's own log span for a `user/message` carrying `source.summary ===
  PRESSURE_NOTICE_SUMMARY`, or a durable `agent/inbox/spliced` insert of one, so
  a restart stays quiet and a fresh generation re-arms by itself. A steered
  notice you do not record in the log is delivered again — the latch reads the
  log, not your memory. An inherited notice belongs to the generation it came
  from and does not latch this one.
- **A reduction must be proven.** The engine reads `surfaceFor` before and after
  and continues only when the durable generation advanced or pressure measurably
  fell (`tokens`, when you meter); otherwise the step is refused with a
  recoverable diagnostic — a no-op, a throw, or an unavailable capability all
  block rather than submit over the limit. Background jobs are never touched.
- **Missing capacity is a refusal, not an unbounded policy.** An unresolvable
  route window rejects the step and says so.
- **Provider overflow gets one bounded retry.** On the context-window-exceeded
  failure code the policy reduces once and allows a single retry for that open
  sequence; a durable surface change is required for the retry to count, and a
  successful assistant response re-arms the sequence. The retry budget is
  process-only and per subject.
- **The notice's substance is the engine's.** The measured numbers, the default
  action (`context_rollover` by default, renameable), and the instruction to
  record durable knowledge before switching are not knobs; `PressureNoticeText`
  replaces only the two labels and the tool name.

## Compatibility red lines (durable identity)

These are written into logs by earlier generations and read back by later ones.
Once a host ships, treat them as frozen:

1. `pluginId` — attribution the codec matches on read.
2. Section names — fixed by the engine; a host cannot change them.
3. `rolloverIdentity` naming scheme — in-flight rollover crash recovery depends on it.
4. Projection `stateVersion` — currently `2` (the state carries the Session
   identity and the fork-inherited cut); bump it whenever the serialized state
   shape or fold semantics change, so stale cached rows are discarded rather
   than misapplied.
5. Legacy tool names — if a tool was renamed, keep folding the old name
   (`rolloverToolNames`); it is a log decoder, not an active alias.
6. The `contextRef` prefix (`context-hit-`) — a conversation reads its own refs
   back, so a new payload format arrives under a new prefix; an old ref then
   rejects as a model-visible error instead of decoding into the wrong event.
7. The pressure notice's `source.summary` (`PRESSURE_NOTICE_SUMMARY`) — the
   latch reads notices back out of live logs to decide whether the current
   generation was already told, so a notice already written must keep matching.
