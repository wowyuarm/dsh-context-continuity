/**
 * The context-continuity coordinator: the one deep module that turns a
 * subject's successful `context_rollover` tool result into its next context
 * generation, and schedules the quiet follow-up owed to a resolved checkpoint.
 *
 * Authority split:
 * - the host's durable store owns the subject→Session binding and rollover audit;
 * - the Session log projection owns intent, checkpoints, and delivery state;
 * - this coordinator owns only process locks and is always reconstructible.
 *
 * The coordinator reacts exclusively after the successful `tool/result` is
 * durably appended — never inside a tool body — so a render/finalize failure
 * can never outrun result durability. The actual swap waits for the containing
 * turn to end and the Agent to be idle, captures later input so no
 * old-generation model request opens, and then defers to the host lifecycle
 * through {@link ContextContinuityHost.executeTransition}.
 * @module @wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity/coordinator
