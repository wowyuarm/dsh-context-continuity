/**
 * The one context-pressure policy: when a subject near its budget is told to
 * prepare a handoff, and what happens at the hard limit.
 *
 * Two thresholds, one order, and no host-side re-derivation of either. Below the
 * handoff budget nothing happens. At it, one structured notice is steered into
 * the running turn — once per generation, latched by durable Session evidence
 * rather than process state, so a restart stays quiet and a rollover re-arms.
 * At the hard limit the request is forced through a reduction first and fails
 * closed unless that reduction is *proven*: the durable surface advanced, or
 * pressure measurably fell. A subject whose route capacity cannot be resolved is
 * refused rather than treated as unbounded.
 *
 * What the notice says about work in hand is the host's vocabulary (a Team
 * Member has Claims and jobs; another subject has whatever it has), and so are
 * the meter, the compaction capability, and the steer itself. What the notice
 * must say — the measured numbers, the default action, and the discipline of
 * recording durable knowledge before switching — is the engine's, because a
 * subject that loses context without those has lost work.
 *
 * The notice's `source.summary` is frozen: hosts read their own history back,
 * and a notice already in a live log has to keep decoding as one.
