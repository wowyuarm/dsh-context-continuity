/**
 * The read-only state one Session's context-continuity projection folds from
 * its durable event log. Every field here is derived from the log alone, so a
 * cold fold over stored events and the live incremental fold converge on the
 * same value — there is no second store.
 *
 * The universal fields (checkpoints, pending rollover, quiet continuations,
 * carried candidates, open calls, turn cursors) are owned by the engine. The
 * one host-specific dimension is {@link ContextProjectionState.boundaries}:
 * which domain events count as timeline anchors, and how they are labelled and
 * attributed, is decided by the host through {@link DomainAnchorRule}. The Agent
 * Team anchors on committed messages, claim changes, and first Thread arrivals;
 * a single-Individual harness anchors on committed Input/Effect/Delivery facts.
